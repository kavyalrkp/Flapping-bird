# Flapping-bird
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game mechanics involve controlling a bird to fly through a series of obstacles without hitting them. It tracks the player's score based on the number of obstacles successfully passed.

How to play:
Start Game: Press the space bar or up arrow to start.
Navigate: Use the space bar or up arrow to make the bird flap and avoid obstacles.
Scoring: Each obstacle successfully passed increases the player's score.
Game Over: The game ends if the bird hits an obstacle or falls off the screen.
